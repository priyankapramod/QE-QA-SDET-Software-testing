Javadoc is an extensible documentation generation system which reads specially formatted comments in Java source code and generates compiled documentation. It is typically used to produce API documentation in the form of HTML web pages.


If you provide a library (such as the one included in the JDK) you also have to provide documentation of the API, else it is totally useless for other programmers. Javadoc allows you to provide documentation while you program. The source for the documentation is entered as “special comments”. Advantages are that you don’t have to retype information that is already part of the source (such as types of parameters) and that it increases the probability of having up-to-date comments (compared to maintaining a documentation in a separate document).

A use case diagram at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved.It is part of external spec of Object Oriented Analysis

In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

The class diagram is the main building block of object-oriented modeling. It is used for general conceptual modeling of the structure of the application, and for detailed modeling translating the models into programming code. Class diagrams can also be used for data modeling.[1] The classes in a class diagram represent both the main elements, interactions in the application, and the classes to be programmed.It is part of internal spec of Object Oriented Analysis

*************************************************************************************************** 


4 kinds of relation ships exist between classes
1. No relation 
2. Association
3. Aggregation(existence of one class is dependent on another class)
4. Composition And Inheritance. (existence of one class is independent on another class)

A JUnit test is a method contained in a class which is only used for testing. This is called a Test class. ... You use an assert method, provided by JUnit or another assert framework, to check an expected result versus the actual result.

Test suite is used to bundle a few unit test cases and run them together. In JUnit, both @RunWith and @Suite annotations are used to run the suite tests.
